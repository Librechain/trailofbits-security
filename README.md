# Trail of Bits Truffle Security Toolbox

This box comes with everything you need to start implementing secure Solidity code using Trail of Bits' tools.

## Installation

Ensure that you have `python3` and `pip3` installed.

First ensure you are in a new and empty directory.

Run the `unbox` command via `npx` and skip to step 3. This will install all necessary dependencies.
```js
npx truffle unbox crytic/trailofbits-security
```

Alternatively, you can install Truffle globally and run the `unbox` command.
```javascript
npm install -g truffle
truffle unbox crytic/trailofbits-security
```

## Usage

Once your contracts have been compiled with `truffle compile`, run `slither .`.
